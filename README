First things first - efficient to-do list
=========================================

This project is a small test project I started to learn play! framework and angularjs.

The idea of the list is inspired by the time matrix of Stephen Covey (The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People). Every item is a http://www.trello.com card. Items are considered as "urgent" when the due date is close to the current date and items can be marked as "important" with a label of the Trello card.

The current state of the application can be found here: http://firstthingsfirst.herokuapp.com/
